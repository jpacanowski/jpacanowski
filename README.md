# About me

I'm a Laravel expert and currently mastering React. I plan also to learn Next.

A lover of real unix operating systems (such as FreeBSD, OpenBSD, Plan 9), UNIX philosophy, ancient Asian philosophies, ancient languages, cosmology and retro computers. When I am offline, I am learning languages, reading books or meditating. A Christian and Buddhist in one person. Minimalist, vegetarian.

On a daily basis, I am working on backend projects. In my spare time, I am developing my own operating system.

__daily work:__ PHP, Laravel, JS/ES6+, React, HTML5, CSS3, SCSS, Flexbox, RWD, WCAG

__spare time:__ C, Linux API, GTK4, osdev, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, ARM, RISC-V, Atari ST/Falcon dev
